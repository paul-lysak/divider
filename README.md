This is my graduate work, a Swing-based desktop application for preprocessing data for finite-element modeling 
of deformation and creep problems. User can create some figure, build a mesh from it and apply edge conditions 
(forces and fixed points)
It was complete back in 2009 and wasn't updated since then (other then switching to Maven)
